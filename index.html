    <h2> Special Session: </h2>
    <h2> "Computational Intelligence Techniques for Observable Smart Grid and Sustainable Energy Systems (CIT-4-OSS)" </h2>
    
    <p>
        Smart grids have rapidly evolved into the backbone of modern energy infrastructure, revolutionizing the interaction between renewable energy sources, 
        traditional power generation, and the ever-changing needs of consumers. Developing smart grid observability methodologies has emerged as a 
        pivotal challenge, pulled by the dual pressures of climate change and surging energy demand. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Advanced metering Infrastructure provides extensive data on energy usage and production, offering insights that extend far beyond simple meter readings. 
    Moreover, as smart grids become increasingly sophisticated, the need for advanced neural network methods to monitor, analyze, and optimize these systems 
    has never been more pressing. 
    </p> 
    <p>
    The new energy paradigm, characterized by increasingly distributed energy sources and a diversifying consumer base, amplifies the complexity of the grid. 
    This evolution demands enhanced situational awareness in contemporary energy systems to ensure flexibility and resilience of the power grid. 
    As distributed generation, energy storage solutions, and renewable energy sources are progressively integrated into the grid, 
    they improve power supply capabilities while simultaneously introducing novel consumption patterns and exerting unprecedented 
    pressures on existing power systems. This necessitates network infrastructures that offer improved observability, accessibility, and controllability, 
    underpinned by distributed intelligence systems  
    </p> 
    <p>
The extraction of useful information, such as load profiles, power quality, consumption and generation patterns, becomes a key component of energy systems, where electrical signal processing plays a key role. Advanced computational intelligence techniques can improve the performance and accuracy of these methods, by providing adaptive, robust, and scalable solutions to the challenges posed by Smart Grid. 

This special session offers an opportunity for researchers from various research fields, such as computational intelligence, artificial neural networks, power and energy systems, to share their insights on how computational intelligence techniques can enhance observability and electrical signal processing for Smart Grids and Sustainable Energy Systems.

This special session is supported by IEEE CIS Task Force on Computational Intelligence in the Energy Domain.
